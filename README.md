## About Nissan

Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. is a Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Yokohama, Japan. The company was founded in 1933 and has grown to become one of the world's largest automotive manufacturers.

## Generations

### Early Years (1933-1960s)

Nissan was established in 1933, originally under the name Jidosha Seizo Co., Ltd. before changing to Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. in 1934. The company began by producing Datsun-branded vehicles, which were known for their reliability and affordability. During this period, Nissan expanded its production facilities and product lineup, focusing primarily on the domestic Japanese market.

### Global Expansion (1960s-1980s)

This era marked Nissan's significant international growth, particularly in the United States where the Datsun brand gained popularity. The introduction of iconic models like the Datsun 510 and the 240Z sports car established Nissan as a major player in the global automotive industry. In 1981, the company officially phased out the Datsun name in favor of Nissan for worldwide markets.

### Innovation and Challenges (1980s-1999)

During this period, Nissan introduced numerous technological innovations and expanded its product range to include luxury vehicles under the Infiniti brand, launched in 1989. However, the company also faced financial difficulties in the late 1990s due to increasing competition and economic challenges in Japan.

### Renault Alliance and Revival (1999-2016)

In 1999, Nissan formed a strategic alliance with French automaker Renault, with Carlos Ghosn appointed to lead Nissan's turnaround. Under the "Nissan Revival Plan," the company underwent significant restructuring, resulting in a return to profitability. This era saw the introduction of innovative vehicles like the all-electric Nissan Leaf and the GT-R supercar.

### Modern Era (2016-Present)

In recent years, Nissan has focused on expanding its electric vehicle lineup, autonomous driving technologies, and mobility services. The alliance with Renault expanded to include Mitsubishi Motors in 2016, creating one of the world's largest automotive groups. Despite facing challenges including leadership changes and market fluctuations, Nissan continues to innovate with models like the Ariya electric crossover and updated versions of its popular vehicles.
